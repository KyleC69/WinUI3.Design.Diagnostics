## Notes and next steps

- **Focus:** This scaffold is intentionally lean but functional: live tree, picker, highlight, basic style and resource views.
- **Expand:** Replace DetailsPanel bindings with richer grids, add a dependency property grid, binding diagnostics, and theme visualization.
- **Polish:** Add a proper icon (package-icon.png), docs/screenshot.png, and XML docs to surface APIs in IntelliSense.

If you want, I can tailor the namespaces, package metadata, and workflow org names to your actual GitHub repo and wire in a property grid plus binding diagnostics next.
